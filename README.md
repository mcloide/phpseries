# PHP Series - Beginner Edition

## Welcome to book code repository

The book code repository stores all the code that is available on the book and it holds an application base that you can use to test what you have learned.

The files were split in 2 categories:

- App
- Chapter Codes

To work with the application base all that is needed is to use the App folder, but all the other code, from the book is stored under the chapter-codes folder.

Please make sure that you read each README file to get an idea of what need's to be done.

* I have added a wiki page that shows how to fully create a VPS with a LAMP server. Check it out: [LAMP VPS](https://github.com/mcloide/phpseries/wiki/Creating-a-Full-LAMP-Stack-Server-in-Digital-Ocean)
