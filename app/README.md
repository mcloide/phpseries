# The application base

## Welcome to the application base

On the application base some files have been prepared for you so you can start coding with little issues.
Always reference (www.php.net) and the book (www.phpseries.com) for any required knowledge with the language.

## Your goal

The goal with this base application is to create an user management application where an administrator will insert, update and delete users and
every user created will be able to login once their have activated their account.

If the user is administrator and logins in he will see a dashboard with the options of creating a user, but if the user isn't an
administrator he will see a different dahsboard with different tasks for him.

Please refer to the database.sql file to get the basic structure for this project.

Good luck and if any questions just find me at: (www.phpseries.com)
